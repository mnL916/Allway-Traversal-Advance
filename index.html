    <h2><br><br><br>How to Play: A Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>As you have noticed by the big text box that reads "Your Total Points", Allway Traversal is a score game. You will get 5 points per half second
    (basically 10 points per second.), so your only objective is to survive as long as posible. As you may be able to tell, spikes aren't helping you
    to survive. To dodge them, press the "W" key to pass through the ceiling (or the floor).<br><br> While playing, you will soon find out that spikes can
    and WILL come together. Against these situations, press the "D" key to traverse forward, granting you a brief immunity to spikes. But use it sparingly:
    a single dash will cost you 70 AP, and the only way to gain AP is with time.<br><br>Now, enough talking, press play and have fun!
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2><br><br>
    <p>1. You will notice that spikes have a different speed. However, they also have different starting times! The top spike takes a
    pretty long time to start appearing, so take advantage!<br>
    2. PLEASE don't hold your keys. Trust me, a simple tap is more than enough. Holding down a key could result in a double-tap switch of floors, or even worse,
    wasting a lot of AP just to dodge a single spike.<br>
    3. Last but not least, spikes are tricky ones! You may notice that spikes sometimes pinch you a bit earlier. Remember, the spikes are a bit closer
    than they appear. Keep it in mind and watch yourself get higher scores.
